Version 0.02 - 22th October 2006
    + Added better support for older versions of dmidecode
      binary output parsing.
    + Improved examples/test.pl.
    + Added examples/synopsis2.pl from the synopsis of
      Parse::DMIDecode::Handle.
    + Allow get_handles() method to be called without any
      qualifying paramaters so to return *All* handle
      objects.
    + Added description() method to handle objects.
    + Added parsed_structures() method to handle objects.
    + Improved parsing inside handle objects to return
      multiple handle objects where appropriate to allow
      easier access to unique data pairs.

Version 0.01 - 19th October 2006
    + Pre-release.
    + Created Parse::DMIDecode::Handle objects for each
      handle structure.
    + Encapsulated the internal data structure which is
      quite fragile so that people cannot just grab items
      out of it.
    + Added accessor methods for header information.
    + Added selection methods to return handle objects.
    + Added a method to return a list of all known
      keyword strings.
    + Added unit tests.
    + Added a whole bunch more since the first release
      was mostly a placeholder.

Version 0.00 - 17th September 2006
    + Initial developer pre-release to save the namespace
      and to discuss API prior to full release.
